# Frontend Frameworks

This document is used to outline research done for frontend frameworks to use in the project

### Svelte (Sveltekit)

There are a number of javascript frameworks out there. All with different approaches and considerations to them.
Ultimately, I tried the big four: React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte. My opinion for personal projects is use the one you like, and I liked Svelte more.
Because Svelte is compiled, it allows for more concise and intuitive syntax to represent areas where sychronization is needed.

If this was not a personal project, React is the obvious choice.

In addition, Rich Harris advocates using Svelte with Sveltekit, so that approach will be taken.
