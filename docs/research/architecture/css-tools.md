# CSS Libraries

Since node has been selected to develop the app, CSS needs to be used to style the UI.
There are several css solutions out there, this document is a summary of the research done to determine the best choid for the project.

## Options

### [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/develop/web)

Material design library is a system of pre-built components that come working out of the box.
- Easy Start up
- Puts limits on how good the UI can look
- Has a svelte library (even easier startup)

### [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind is a css utility library. It does not provide out of the box components, but simplifies the styling process for css.
- Most used modern css system in the current market
- Lots of features, very extensible
- Need to learn a css system
- Build UI components from scratch
- Supposedly still plays well with sveltekit


### [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/)

Gives is some more personality than some standard out of the box component.
- Easy start up
- Adds some personality
- Same limitations as Material Design


## Decision

The choice here for me is tailwind css.
While it may take a little more work up front, I think that in the long run it would be a good technology to learn.
It also allow me to create beautiful UI's in the future if I decide to spend the time on it.
