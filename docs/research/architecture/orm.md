# ORM's

Since we are using Sqlite for peristant storage, and ORM should be determined.

## Options

### TypeORM

- very popular solution
- **deal breaker**: uses decorators, which is not supported by esbuild
- documentation is lacking

### Sequalize

- very popular solution
- weird autogenerated methods
- no auto migrations

### Prisma

- Follows graphql declarative syntax
- auto migrations

## Decision

Going with Prisma here
