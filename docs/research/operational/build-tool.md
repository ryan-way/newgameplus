# Builds tools

The purpose of this document is to choose a build tool

## Options

### Vite

- Comes shipped out of the box with sveltekit, so only needs to be setup for electron
- Has the goal of being simple to configure
- Blazingly fast
- comes with a test tool (vitest)

### Webpack

- Most popular javascript bundler
- Difficult to configure
- Slow

Vite is the better option here.
